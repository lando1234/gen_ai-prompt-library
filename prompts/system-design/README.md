# System Design

Prompts for **architecture, technical design, and system-level thinking**.

---

## What Belongs Here

- System architecture design prompts
- Technical decision-making support
- Infrastructure and deployment design
- Database and data modeling prompts
- API design and architecture
- Scalability and performance planning
- Trade-off analysis for technical choices

---

## Characteristics

- **Focus on structure and architecture**: Not implementation details
- **Multi-component thinking**: Systems, not single functions
- **Trade-offs and constraints**: Evaluating options, not just building
- **Production scale considerations**: Scalability, reliability, maintainability

---

## Complexity Range

**Advanced → Expert**

System design prompts require:
- Deep technical knowledge
- Experience with production systems
- Understanding of architectural patterns
- Ability to reason about trade-offs

## Examples of Prompts That Belong Here

- `design-microservices-architecture.md`
- `choose-database-for-use-case.md`
- `design-api-for-service.md`
- `evaluate-system-scalability.md`
- `create-disaster-recovery-plan.md`

---

## Examples of Prompts That DON'T Belong Here

- Code implementation (→ `code-generation/`)
- Code review or analysis (→ `analysis/`)
- Product strategy (→ `strategic/`)
- Prompt design (→ `meta-prompts/`)

**Rule of thumb:** If the output is architecture/design documentation (not code), it belongs here.
