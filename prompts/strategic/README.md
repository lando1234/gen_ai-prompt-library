# Strategic

Prompts for **product, business, and high-level decision support**.

---

## What Belongs Here

- Product requirements and roadmapping
- Business strategy and prioritization
- Technical decision-making (build vs. buy)
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Stakeholder communication and alignment
- High-level planning and scoping

---

## Characteristics

- **Focus on outcomes and impact**: Not implementation details
- **Business and product context**: Market, users, value
- **Trade-offs and priorities**: Balancing constraints (time, cost, quality)
- **Cross-functional thinking**: Engineering + product + business

---

## Complexity Range

**Intermediate → Advanced**

Strategic prompts require:
- Business and product acumen
- Understanding of technical constraints
- Ability to reason about trade-offs
- Stakeholder management experience

---

## Examples of Prompts That Belong Here

- `prioritize-features-by-impact.md`
- `create-product-requirements-document.md`
- `evaluate-build-vs-buy-decision.md`
- `draft-technical-rfc.md`
- `assess-project-risk-and-mitigation.md`

---

## Examples of Prompts That DON'T Belong Here

- Code or system implementation (→ `code-generation/` or `system-design/`)
- Technical review (→ `analysis/`)
- Prompt creation (→ `meta-prompts/`)
- Purely technical architecture (→ `system-design/`)

**Rule of thumb:** If the output informs **what to build and why**, not **how to build it**, it belongs here.

## Best Practices for Strategic Prompts

1. **Define success metrics**: How do we measure if this decision was right?
2. **Include constraints explicitly**: Budget, timeline, team size, risk tolerance
3. **Balance technical and business factors**: Not just "what's technically best"
4. **Stakeholder context**: Who needs to approve? Who is affected?
5. **Output format for decision-making**: Pros/cons, scoring matrices, recommendations
